  **Arch Linux** is a lightweight, do-it-yourself (DIY) distribution meaning that you only get what you install. For more information see their [FAQ](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Frequently_asked_questions).

  Arch Linux has a rolling release cycle. There is no fixed release schedule and packages are updated very frequently.

  Being a DIY distribution, the user is expected to setup and maintain their system. Since September 2020, Arch has an [official installer](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Archinstall) to make the installation process a little easier.

  A large portion of [Arch Linux's packages](https://reproducible.archlinux.org) are [reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org").
