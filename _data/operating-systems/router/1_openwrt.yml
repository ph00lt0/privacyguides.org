  **OpenWrt** is an operating system (in particular, an embedded operating system) based on the Linux kernel, primarily used on embedded devices to route network traffic. The main components are the Linux kernel, util-linux, uClibc and BusyBox. All components have been optimized for size, to be small enough for fitting into the limited storage and memory available in home routers.

  ## Notes
  Consult the [Table of Hardware](https://openwrt.org/toh/start) to check if your device is supported.
